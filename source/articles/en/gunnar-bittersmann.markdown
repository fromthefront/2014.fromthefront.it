Building responsive (what else?) and accessible (what else?) web pages, I aim at a better understanding between humans and machines. I review and translate articles on the W3C i18n website, help organizing the World Usability Day Berlin and struggle not to forget how to play the guitar."

talkTitle: CSS preprocessors for the best of both worlds
---

While purists propagate to not mix content structure (HTML), presentation (CSS) and behavior (JavaScript) layers for the reason of maintainability, concepts like OOCSS aim at the same goal, but from a different angle: reusable CSS code, at the expense of bloated, presentational mark-up, violating the separation of concerns.
Can’t we have both, clean mark-up and reusable CSS? The benefits of both approaches without the drawbacks?
Yes, we can. This talk shows how to take the OO concept out of the HTML and put it where it belongs to: into the style sheet. Not directly into the CSS though, but into an intermediate layer provided by a CSS preprocessor like Sass.
Like Ogers and onions, concepts have layers. Unlike Ogers and onions, they don’t always stink, but eventually lead to the best of both worlds.
