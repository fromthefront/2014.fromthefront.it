talkTitle: With great power comes great (development) responsibility
---

Developers are often seem as mere implementors, when the reality is that their choices can have a huge impact on the overall success of projects - for good, or for bad.
A user-centric design process is common in most projects, but in this talk we’ll cover how viewing usability and responsibility as part of development decisions is equally as important.
We’ll travel through time from the beginning of the digital age, observing how a focus on users (or lack of) has helped to make or break the success of ideas. We’ll also consider how other industries apply similar principles, and how we can learn from them, finishing with some tips to apply to our builds.
