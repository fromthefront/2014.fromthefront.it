You may know him from such books as <a href="http://domscripting.com/">DOM Scripting: JavaScript’s New Hope</a>, <a href="http://bulletproofajax.com/">Bulletproof Ajax - The Browser Strikes Back</a>, and <a href="http://html5forwebdesigners.com/">HTML5 For Web Designers - Return Of The Standards</a>.

He also made the website <a href="http://huffduffer.com/">Huffduffer</a> to allow people to make podcasts of found sounds&mdash;it’s like Instapaper for audio files. Hailing from Erin’s green shores, Jeremy maintains his link to Irish traditional music running the community site <a href="http://thesession.org/">The Session</a>. He also indulges a darker side of his bouzouki-playing in the band <a href="http://saltercane.com/">Salter Cane</a>. Jeremy spends most of his time goofing off on the internet, documenting his time-wasting on <a href="http://adactio.com/">adactio.com,</a> where he has been writing for over ten years.'

We’re working on increasingly complex websites. There’s a temptation to match this growth with increasingly complex solutions. But there’s a real value in keeping things simple...or at least _starting_ things simple. If you can build a solid robust foundation, there’s a good chance that your work will be future-friendly. Prepare to have your brain subtly rewired as we look beneath the surface-level implementation details of the web to reveal the semantic structure below. Whether you’re publishing content or building the latest hot app, the principle of progressive enhancement will change the way you think about your work.
