With so many frameworks, boilerplates and starting points to choose from in front-end development we are selling ourselves short with instant 'cookie cutter’, ‘one size fits all’ development. I’ll go through my idea of rolling your own starting point but taking the code you like from others adapting as you go and documenting for your future self and team ultimately caring about your code and making it /#codelicious/.
