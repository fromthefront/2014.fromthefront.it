It's probably fair to say that *the* hot web technology of 2014 is Web Components, a suite of technologies including templates, custom elements and Shadow DOM, aimed at creating reusable elements that are powerful, self-contained, and shareable. In this talk I will look at each of the technologies in the suite, focusing not only on their technical implementation but also putting them in context of their purpose and importance. I will show how quite simple HTML, CSS and JS are combined to create the future of web development, and why it matters to you and the users of the web.
