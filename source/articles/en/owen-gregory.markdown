longbio: 'Owen Gregory is a freelance editor, copy editor and proofreader. Before moving into editing, he was a website designer for over ten years. Recently he’s edited things you’ve probably read: books and articles for Five Simple Steps and Smashing Media, as well as the daily advent goodness of 24 ways each December. Although he prefers to stay behind the scenes, as invisible as his editing work, he has made the occasional foray into writing and speaking on web design. Owen is also what is sometimes called a classically trained musician, and he plays oboe and cor anglais in a number of orchestras.'

The currency of written communication — words on the page, words on the screen — comprises many denominations. To further our ends in web design and development, we freely spend and receive several. Our community thrives on sharing knowledge and experience through the written word. We write articles to teach and to document our processes. Some of us write books. But can there be a web design discourse that isn't focused on tools and technique? Maybe received wisdom about online writing holds us back from gaining a deeper understanding of what we do.
