The presentation covers the reasons why we need to be automating our front-end processes, and the tools you can use to achieve that. 

To begin with, we'll look at what automation does for us, why it is important, and how to make it work for us. 

We'll consider the option to build first, before we do anything else in the project, and analyze the trade-offs in doing that. <br>
We'll look at specific tasks such compiling static assets, as well as minifying them, and generating spritesheets or icon fonts. <br>
We'll go into more advanced topics such as testing, continuous integration, deployments, and continuous development, as well.  

Later on, we'll go over package managers, how these play with build systems and how to use bower or npm to automate asset management and optimization, while keeping our code-base succinct.
