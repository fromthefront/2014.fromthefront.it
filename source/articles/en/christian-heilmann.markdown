talkTitle: Rubbing the Sankara stones the wrong way
---
 
Much of the plot of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom revolves around the Sankara stones, their powers, how much problems it brings to remove them from their original dwellings, and how they light up when they get close to another. We have something similar in web development: the separation of concerns - markup, presentation and behaviour. But over all these years we've forgotten some things about them. In this closing keynote Chris Heilmann of Mozilla will remind us of our powers, hint at new ones and give advice how to avoid being eaten by crocodiles.
