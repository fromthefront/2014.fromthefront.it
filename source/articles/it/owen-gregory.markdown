 Owen Gregory is a freelance editor, copy editor and proofreader. Before moving into editing, he was a website designer for over ten years. Recently he’s edited things you’ve probably read: books and articles for Five Simple Steps and Smashing Media, as well as the daily advent goodness of 24 ways each December. Although he prefers to stay behind the scenes, as invisible as his editing work, he has made the occasional foray into writing and speaking on web design. Owen is also what is sometimes called a classically trained musician, and he plays oboe and cor anglais in a number of orchestras.
