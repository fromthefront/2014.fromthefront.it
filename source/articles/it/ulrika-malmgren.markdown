Ulrika has been passionate about testing for almost a decade and has worked with test on a bunch of different products, using both exploratory and automated testing. She holds a course in Agile Testing and has held seminars and presentations on this topic. She believes that when creating good systems, everyone needs to care about quality and think about it from the very beginning and she loves to have the conversation on how you can do that. Even though testing might be Ulrika's favorite topic, she takes great pride in the fact that she "speaks programmer" and enjoys most topics when it comes to software development.
