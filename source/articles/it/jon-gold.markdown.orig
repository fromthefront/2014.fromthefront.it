Jon is a designer and full-stack developer (but definitely not a ‘unicorn’). Before heading out on his own, he worked at whole bunch of startups, including <a href="http://makeshift.io/">Makeshift</a> (where he founded <a href="http://hiremyfriend.io/">Hire My Friend</a>) and <a href="http://getprismatic.com/">Prismatic</a>. Gets excited about new technology, buffalo wings, and .vimrc files.
