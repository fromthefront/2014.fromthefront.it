Nicolas Bevacqua is a 25 year old full-stack developer, living in Argentina and working as an employee at a startup, building a cross-device app maker with a full blown in-browser editor, using Node (MEAN), Angular, Lodash, and then there's also the Android / iOS apps we end up generating.

He contributes to the community by sharing open-source Node modules, and blogging about his experience whenever he finds the time.

He's currently writing a book on JavaScript Application Design (and build processes), which you can find it at [http://bevacqua.io/bf](http://bevacqua.io/bf)
