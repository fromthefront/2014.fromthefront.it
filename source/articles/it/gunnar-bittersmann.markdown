Having a programming and a UX background, my passion is where both meet: at the frontend. Building responsive (what else?) and accessible (what else?) web pages, I aim at a better understanding between humans and machines. I review and translate articles on the W3C i18n website, help organizing the World Usability Day Berlin and struggle not to forget how to play the guitar.
